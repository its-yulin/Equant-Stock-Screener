This website uses the front-end H5 + CSS + JS, jQuery framework and Ajax interactive technology. The back-end uses the python web page framework flash to collect user data and operations through the front-end, return to the back-end for processing and analysis, and then return to the front-end display results again.
 
My goal is to deliver an efficient and strong stock screener website aiming at facilitating retail investors in the U.S equity market. I started with PySimpleGUI trying to present the first MVP. Then, I learned Django and Flask on a basic level. As the team decide to proceed our project with Flask, I kept exploring more on Flask, especially Flask-Login for user authentication and Flask-SQLAlchemy handling the data connection across the app. As part of the front-end team, I started with simple HTML. As we perfect our product, I learned CSS + JS along with the Bootstrap framework to enhance user experience and deliver a more presentable product. Bootstrap combined with Jinja2 gave me a lot of power and freedom to manipulate the front-end design. In order to implement the account system and the watchlist function, I learned how to build and deploy both MySQL and SQLite database to support the function.
